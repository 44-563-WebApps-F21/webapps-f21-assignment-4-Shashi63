            PRINCE PETRO. He is beginning well, this young Czar.
            <br>
            BARON RAFF (_shrugs his shoulders_). All young Czars do begin well.
            COUNT R. And end badly
            <br>
            [1]MARQ. DE POIV. Well, I have no right to complain. He has done me one
            good service, at any rate
             <br>
             PRINCE PETRO. Cancelled your appointment to Archangel, I suppose?
             <br>
             MARQ. DE POIV. Yes; my head wouldn't have been safe there for an
             hour.[1]
             <br>
             (_Enter GENERAL KOTEMKIN._)
             <br>
             BARON RAFF. Ah! General, any more news of our romantic Emperor?
             <br>
             GEN. KOTEMK. You are quite right to call him romantic, Baron; a week ago
             I found him amusing himself in a garret with a company of strolling
             players; to-day his whim is all the convicts in Siberia are to be
             recalled, and political prisoners, as he calls them, amnestied.
             <br>
             PRINCE PETRO. Political prisoners! Why, half of them are no better than
             common murderers!
