        <h5>ACT II</h5>
        <h6>SCENE.--_Council Chamber in the Emperor's Palace, hung with yellow
            tapestry. Table, with chair of State, set for the Czar; window behind,
            opening on to a balcony. As the scene progresses the light outside gets
            darker._</h6>

            PRINCE PETRO. So our young scatter-brained Czarevitch has been forgiven
            at last, and is to take his seat here again.
            <br>
            PRINCE PAUL. Yes; if that is not meant as an extra punishment. For my
            own part, at least, I find these Cabinet Councils extremely exhausting.
            <br>
             PRINCE PETRO. Naturally; you are always speaking.
             <br>
             PRINCE PAUL. No; I think it must be that I have to listen sometimes.
             <br>
             COUNT R. Still, anything is better than being kept in a sort of prison,
             like he was--never allowed to go out into the world.
             <br>
             PRINCE PAUL. My dear Count, for romantic young people like he is, the
             world always looks best at a distance; and a prison where one's allowed
             to order one's own dinner is not at all a bad place. (_Enter the
             CZAREVITCH. The courtiers rise._) Ah! good afternoon, Prince. Your
             Highness is looking a little pale to-day.
             <br>
             CZARE. (_slowly, after a pause_). I want change of air
             <br>
             PRINCE PAUL (_smiling_). A most revolutionary sentiment! Your Imperial
             father would highly disapprove of any reforms with the thermometer in
             Russia.
             <br>
             CZARE. (_bitterly_). My Imperial father had kept me for six months in
             this dungeon of a palace. This morning he has me suddenly woke up to see
             some wretched Nihilists hung; it sickened me, the bloody butchery,
             though it was a noble thing to see how well these men can die.
